                    <li>A Pause with Purpose:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I embarked on a path less traveled ‚Äì one guided by the fervor of fatherhood. 
                                These years were a conscious pause, a period to nurture my children's growth and development. 
                                In the role of a freelance software consultant and salesman, I bridged the gap between my aspirations 
                                and my responsibilities. The traditional confines of employment couldn't define me as a father, 
                                and so I embraced independence as the gateway to balance.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This journey found its crescendo in the realm of Solutions Specialist, Web, Social Media and some of marketing.
                                Here, I marry innovation with parenting, crafting a legacy for both my children and the businesses I serve.
                                With a heart driven by efficiency and impact, I'm not just designing websites; I'm designing a future where 
                                dedication knows no boundaries.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            I invite you to join me at the crossroads of ambition and devotion.
                            Let's create a world where coding and caring coexist, where a father's love fuels digital revolutions, 
                            one project at a time.

            <p>Jun 1997 - May 2008</p>
            <p>
                My journey traces back to the core of software development, where I honed my expertise in crafting 
                intricate client-server systems and desktop applications for the Windows platform, with a focus on 
                the financial and banking sectors.

                    <li>
                        During my tenure as a Software Consultant Analyst Consultant with ABC Log√≠stica & AMS Editorial through DATEXCORP,
                        I further refined my skills in delivering tailored solutions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I also contributed as a systems development specialist at SKY, leaving my mark on innovative projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I had the privilege of serving as a Consultant Analyst and Programmer for distinguished institutions
                        including Banco Nacional de Costa Rica and Banco Central de Costa Rica, Grupo IXE 6 Santander through
                        AIS-INT
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My journey continued with impactful roles, including Analyst Programmer positions at ABN Amro Bank, 
                        Piso Financiero Bancomer, Grupo Bimbo, CNBV, Grupo Fertinal, and Ferromex through DDEMESIS and some other
                        software intermediaries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Drawing from this rich foundation, I've seamlessly transitioned to pioneering WEB Digital Solutions, 
                    where my deep-rooted experience continues to drive transformative outcomes. It's more than a transition; 
                    it's the culmination of a journey fueled by dedication and the desire to create meaningful impact.
